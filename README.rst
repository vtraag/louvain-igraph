**Warning** 

This package has been superseded by the `leidenalg
<https://github.com/vtraag/leidenalg>`_ package and will no longer be
maintained.

louvain-igraph
==============

This package implements the louvain algorithm in ``C++`` and exposes it to
``python``.  It relies on ``(python-)igraph`` for it to function. Besides the
relative flexibility of the implementation, it also scales well, and can be run
on graphs of millions of nodes (as long as they can fit in memory). The core
function is ``find_partition`` which finds the optimal partition using the
louvain algorithm [1]_ for a number of different methods. The methods currently
implemented are (1) modularity [2]_, (2) Reichardt and Bornholdt's model using
the configuration null model and the Erdös-Rényi null model [3]_, (3) the
constant Potts model (CPM) [4]_, (4) Significance [5]_, and finally (5)
Surprise [6]_. In addition, it supports multiplex partition optimisation
allowing community detection on for example negative links [7]_ or multiple
time slices [8]_. It also provides some support for community detection on
bipartite graphs. See the `documentation
<http://louvain-igraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.

Installation
------------

In short: ``pip install louvain``. All major platforms are supported on
Python>=3.5, earlier versions of Python are no longer supported. Alternatively,
you can install from Anaconda (channels ``conda-forge``).

For Unix like systems it is possible to install from source. For Windows this is
overly complicated, and you are recommended to use the binary wheels. The igraph
``C`` core library is provided within this package, and is automatically
compiled. If you encounter any issue with compilation, please see
http://igraph.org. 

Make sure you have all necessary tools for compilation. In Ubuntu this can be
installed using ``sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake flex
bison``, please refer to the documentation for your specific system.  Make sure
that not only ``gcc`` is installed, but also ``g++``, as the ``louvain-igraph``
package is programmed in ``C++``.

You can check if all went well by running a variety of tests using ``python
setup.py test``.

There are basically two installation modes, similar to the python-igraph package
itself (from which most of the setup.py comes).

1. No ``C`` core library is installed yet. The ``C`` core
   library of igraph that is provided within the ``louvain-igraph`` package is
   compiled.
2. A ``C`` core library is already installed. In this case, you may link
   dynamically to the already installed version by specifying
   ``--no-pkg-config``. This is probably also the version that is used by the
   igraph package, but you may want to double check this.

In case the ``python-igraph`` package is already installed before, make sure that
both use the **same versions** (at least the same minor version, which should be
API compatible).

Troubleshooting
---------------

In case of any problems, best to start over with a clean environment. Make sure
you remove the ``python-igraph`` package completely, remove the ``C`` core
library and remove the ``louvain-igraph`` package. Then, do a complete reinstall
starting from ``pip install louvain-igraph``. In case you want a dynamic library be
sure to then install the ``C`` core library from source before. Make sure you
**install the same versions**.

Usage
-----

There is no standalone version of ``louvain-igraph``, and you will always need
python to access it. There are no plans for developing a standalone version or
R support. So, use python. Please refer to the documentation for more details
on function calls and parameters.

Just to get you started, below the essential parts.
To start, make sure to import the packages:

>>> import louvain
>>> import igraph as ig

We'll create a random graph for testing purposes:

>>> G = ig.Graph.Erdos_Renyi(100, 0.1);

For simply finding a partition use:

>>> part = louvain.find_partition(G, louvain.ModularityVertexPartition);
